This is a set of patches for the HTTPClient V0.3-3 to enable https
using any SSL package which implements the javax.net.ssl interface
defined by Sun. One implementation of this interface can be found
in the ssl.jar and x509v1.jar classes supplied with HotJava 1.1.5
(if you get the SSL-enabled version), and in the JavaWebServer.

This package contains the modified sources and the resulting class
files. Save a copy of the original files in the HTTPClient distribution,
and then copy these files into there. When running your application
make sure to include the neccessary jar file(s) in your CLASSPATH.

If you are running this with HotJava's classes then include
<hotjava-home>/lib/ssl.jar and <hotjava-home>/lib/x509v1.jar in
your CLASSPATH. Also, you must make sure the shared-library/dll is
in the search paths. For solaris/sparc this means that
<hotjava-home>/lib/sparc/ssl/ must be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (it needs
to find libjsafe.so); for NT this means that <hotjava-home>/bin/ must
be in either your PATH or PWD (it needs to find jsafe.dll). For other
platforms you'll have to figure out the equivalent setup. Note that
the HotJava libs only work under JDK 1.1.x, not JDK 1.2.

If you are using the classes from the JavaWebServer then the setup is
similar, except that you need to point the paths (CLASSPATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, or PWD) to <jws-install>/lib/ (which contains
both the jar files and the shared library).
